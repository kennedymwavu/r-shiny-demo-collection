# show downloading spinner

simple demo on how to show that a download is being processed
in [shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny).

handy when downloading large files, or for reports which need to be
rendered first before finally being downloaded.

works for all download btns in your app & shiny modules. even
dynamically rendered ones.

good UX.

will write a blog post soon.
